## Getting Started

### Add Firebase to your Flutter app

### Brief ideas for this awesome app.
This is a multi functional application, divided into four separated components: Stuffs management, Focus, Budget tracker, Notebooks.

#### Stuffs management
Inspired by [less](http://mnmlist.com/less/), this component give you a overview how much stuffs you have. And from here you can throw your stuffs away, or donate it or sell it... 

#### Focus/Thing to do today
Have you ever being so overwhelmed or getting distracted all the time during the day, there might be a lot of things to do at a time or maybe you don't have anything to do ;). 
 
#### Budget tracker
Keep track you income and expense.

#### Notebooks
Hmm, I just got a new idea for this awesome app, i will note it here...
